CGI::ArgChecker - An extensible CGI parameter validation module (allowing
commonly used checks on parameters to be called more concisely and
consistently).

free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the same terms
as Perl itself.

This is really a simple wrapper around String::Checker; most of the
interesting reading is in that module's documentation.

This module has only been tested under FreeBSD, Linux and Solaris, though
I can't think of any reason why it shouldn't work elsewhere.
